# LosingChessConsole
A c# console application that allows a player to play against AI in the chess variant referred to as Losing Chess or sometimes called Suicide Chess. The intent of this project is to create a basic implementation and to have a simple branching AI as version 1. 

# Version 1 Release 
This project has been seen through to completion and a full game can be played against an AI opponent. The AI opponent is capable of abiding by the rules of the game and playing to victory or defeat. This could be a useful codeset for someone looking at creating their own c# implementation.

# Possible Improvements
* Allow player to choose their color. The Player currently is always white. 
* AI improvements. The AI currently has no predictive ability
* Graphical overlay
* Machine learning

# Note by Benzidrine
For myself as a contributor I feel I have led this project as far as I meant to. While it would be fun to setup a local database and train an AI for this, I have decided to pursue a new developmemnt using some principles I learned from this one. I will still take a look at any issues and there is another Contributor, MechatronicsGuyPAL, that is still interested in further development.
